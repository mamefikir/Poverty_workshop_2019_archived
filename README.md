# Poverty Measurement Workshop | July, 2019

Poverty economists play a key role in maintaining the quality of poverty data and data collection in the World Bank Group's client countries by providing timely advice and recommendations to national statistics bureaus. These efforts support nationally-owned, transparent systems and methodologies for tracking poverty and other welfare outcomes. 

The materials on this site aim to help enhance the quality of advice and integrated knowledge on sustaining past welfare gains in the face of slower global growth. These resources are taken from the workshop, which provides a comprehensive technical review of methods, using actual household survey data.

The training covers all steps of poverty measurement, from household survey data collection (including basic knowledge of sampling), to the creation of consumption aggregates, price and household composition adjustments, the construction of poverty lines, different measures of poverty, and sensitivity analysis.
