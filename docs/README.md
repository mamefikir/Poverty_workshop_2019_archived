# Consumption Aggregate â€“ Durables
![durables](/durables/)

Durable goods are relevant components of the welfare aggregate. One of their characteristics is that they last for several years and it is clearly not their expenditure on purchases the appropriate measure of their consumption. Instead, it is the value of services that the household receives from all durables goods in its possession over the relevant time period.
This session presents first a brief discussion of the theoretical framework. It follows with an introduction to several methods of estimating the value of services from durable goods conditioned on the information available in the household survey. It ends with examples of empirical applications of the different methodologies and their impacts on poverty measures.
