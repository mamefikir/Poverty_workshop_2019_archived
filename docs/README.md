# Consumption Aggregate

## Durables
[link to presentation](https://worldbank.github.io/Poverty_workshop_2019/Day3/Session2-ConsAgg_durables/durables.html#1)

Durable goods are relevant components of the welfare aggregate. One of their characteristics is that they last for several years and it is clearly not their expenditure on purchases the appropriate measure of their consumption. Instead, it is the value of services that the household receives from all durables goods in its possession over the relevant time period.
This session presents first a brief discussion of the theoretical framework. It follows with an introduction to several methods of estimating the value of services from durable goods conditioned on the information available in the household survey. It ends with examples of empirical applications of the different methodologies and their impacts on poverty measures.


## Housing

Housing is often on of the most problematic components of the household consumption aggregate. As with durable goods, the appropriate measure of housing consumption is a measure in monetary terms of the flow of services that the household receives from occupying its dwelling.  If rental markets are perfect and all households rent their dwellings, the rent paid is the obvious choice to include in the consumption aggregate. But this is not often the case, either because rents are subsidized, or because households own their dwellings. Even if the dwelling is owned by the household or received free of charge or with a subsidized rent, an estimate of the annual rental equivalent must be included, when possible, in the consumption aggregate.
After presenting motivations and a brief literature review on the problem of rent imputation, this session will focus on the different methods to estimate rent for home-owners. It ends with examples of empirical applications of the different methodologies and their impacts on poverty measures.
